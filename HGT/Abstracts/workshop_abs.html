<ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Lie 2-groups and quantum gravity
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> We describe the role which certain Lie 2-groups (Lie crossed modules) can play in the problem of canonical quantization of General Relativity. We introduce the Poincare 2-group and the corresponding BFCG topological theory and describe the canonical formulation. We
then briefly describe the reduced phase space canonical quantization and the loop quantization. We then discuss how to categorify the loop quantization and argue that the 3-dimensional Euclidean 2-group should be used in the case of General Relativity.<br>

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Properads and Homotopy Algebras Related to Surfaces
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Starting from a biased definition of a properad, we describe explicitly algebras over the cobar construction of a properad.  Equivalent description in terms of solutions of generalized master equations, which can be interpreted as homological differential operators, are explained from the properadic point of view. This is parallel to the Barannikov's theory for modular operads leading to a generalizations of BV formalism. In addition to well known IBL-homotopy algebras, the examples include their associative analogues, which we call IBA-homotopy algebras, and a combination of the above two.

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Mapping class group actions in Kitaev models and Hopf algebra gauge theory
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Mapping class group actions represent certain cobordisms in topological
quantum field theory that can be implemented directly in a Hamiltonian
formulation of the theory.  We explain how to obtain mapping class group
actions on Kitaev models and in combinatorial models based on
quasitriangular Hopf algebras. The latter can be viewed as a Hopf
algebra valued gauge theory and generalise Kitaev models.  We illustrate
this with the example of the SL(2,Z)-action on Kitaev models and
combinatorial models on the torus.

<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> The study of loop braid groups has been widely developed during the last twenty years, in different domains of mathematics and mathematical physics. They have been called with several names such as motion groups, groups of permutation-conjugacy automorphisms, braid-permutation groups, welded braid groups and untwisted ring groups. We will give a glance on how every equivalent definition carries open questions in the domain it belongs to.

<ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Loops, Necklaces and Braiding for 3D Topological Phases
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Particle exchange in 2D topological phases of matter is a key source of quantum gates in the Kitaev-Freedman topological model for quantum computation.  The mathematical formulation is quite well-developed: the systems are modeled by (2+1)TQFTs/modular categories and particle exchange is manifested in braid group representations.  The situation with 3D topological
phases remains poorly understood, but is a compelling subject nonetheless.  In analogy with the 2D formulation we expect that (extended) (3+1)TQFT will yield motion group representations for configurations of loops in in R^3, which could be useful for quantum gates.  Since explicit calculations of such representations have not been carried out, we have considered the representation theory of motion groups directly.  I will describe some joint work on two particular configurations: free unlinked loops and the necklace configuration.  Our results lead to some speculation on the potential for 3D topological quantum computation.<br/>
Time permitting, I will also discuss spin TQFT models that include fermions constructed from super-modular categories.  Using the Walker-Wang model one can construct (3+1)TQFTs as well. <br>

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Higher gauge theory moduli spaces, surface transport and applications
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> A hallmark of higher gauge theory (HGT) is parallel transport along surfaces and paths, i.e. not just along paths as in ordinary gauge theory. Especially in the non-abelian setting, this leads one into higher-dimensional algebra (HDA), e.g. the algebra of double groupoids, which in plain language involves the manipulation of symbols attached to squares and their edges, placed in planar arrays. Gauge equivalent connections are also physically equivalent, so in ordinary gauge theory it is important to understand the moduli space of connections modulo gauge transformations, either as a quotient space or more subtly as a groupoid. I will start by describing work with Jeffrey Morton on the equivalent notions in HGT, where the moduli space of HGT connections modulo gauge transformations turns out to be naturally described by a double groupoid. The central notion for understanding these HGT moduli spaces is surface transport and the HDA around it. <br/>
In the remaining time I will attempt to address the central theme of the meeting by describing several arenas where one might expect HGT to make contact with experiment. Again the leitmotiv is surface transport and HDA, which I hope to relate to various modified 2-dimensional TQFT (Topological Quantum Field Theory) constructions, due to Beliakova-Wagner and Bragança-P., and to 2-dimensional lattice models in statistical mechanics, studied amongst others by Junya Yagi and collaborators.

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Teleparallel supergravity as a higher gauge theory
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Teleparallel gravity is a variant of general relativity where gravity is described by a flat connection with torsion. Baez and Wise have shown the connection and its torsion fit together into a 2-connection, so teleparallel gravity is actually a higher gauge theory. In this talk, I describe joint work with Wise to extend this to the case of supergravity, giving teleparallel supergravity as a higher gauge theory.

<ul> <b> TITLE: </b> An M5-brane model
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Multiple M5-branes are known to be effectively described by a mysterious
superconformal field theory in six dimensions, known as the (2,0)-theory or as "theory X".  This theory is crucial to the understanding of M-theory and dualities in string theory. It is generally believed that this theory only exists on the quantum level. If, however, there is a
classical description then it has to be a higher gauge theory. In this talk I start by reviewing the (2,0)-theory and some of its desired features. I then motivate a particular choice of higher gauge structure and give a complete supersymmetric action that passes many consistency checks.

<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> Building on the work of Ocneanu, we define the so called tube algebra for state-sum topological quantum field theories and describe how the simple modules can be interpreted as irreducible topological excitations in the theory. We then apply the tube algebra construction to 2+1D and 3+1D higher lattice gauge theories arising from finite 2-groups in order to describe irreducible point-like and loop-like excitations.

<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> The success of ordinary Chern–Simons theory as a quantum field theoretic framework for the computation of ordinary knot invariants suggests that categorified versions of Chern–Simons theory may compute higher knot invariants. For a flat 2–connection in strict 2-gauge theory, we define the 2-holonomy of surface knots of arbitrary genus and determine its covariance properties under 1–gauge transformation and change of base data. We also discuss appropriate notions of tracing of 2-holonomies. <br>

<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> I will explain a general strategy to lift (2+1)D topological phases, in particular string nets, to (3+1)D models with line defects. This allows a systematic construction of (3+1)D topological theories with defects, including an improved version of the Walker-Wang model.  It has also an interesting application to quantum gravity as it leads to  quantum geometry realizations for which all geometric operators have discrete and bounded spectra.  I will furthermore comment on some interesting (self-) duality relations that emerge in these constructions.

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Representation theory for fusion categories
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> A representation of a fusion category C consists of a ring R, and a tensor functor C --> Bim(R) to the category of R-R-bimodules. We describe a universal representation C --> Bim(R), where R is a certain von Neumann algebra. This representation is unique up to isomorphism, by a deep result of Popa. We prove that if C and D are Morita equivalent fusion categories, then the commutants of their universal representations C --> Bim(R) and D --> Bim(R) are equivalent as tensor categories.

     <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Topological quantum phases of matter
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> It is almost a decade ago that the first-generation topological insulators (TIs) with nontrivial electronic band structures in the energy-momentum space were discovered in existing materials. Since then, the search for ideal topological materials (TMs) in terms of theoretical description and future application, i.e. a simple electronic band structure has been intensified and the topic of the topological quantum phase of matter in solid state physics became of great interest. Why? There are at least the following two reasons:<br>
 
1) The helical spin texture of topological edge (or surface) states hosting massless Dirac fermions whose presence is protected by peculiar symmetries, e.g. time-reversal symmetry, inversion symmetry, crystalline symmetry, etc., can be a promising platform for topotronics; an extended concept of spintronics.<br>
2) Strong spin-orbit coupling materials such as TMs with superconductivity are candidates for topological superconductors (TSCs) hosting Majorana fermions (MFs) at their edges/surfaces. MFs are predicted to be mysterious uncharged quasiparticles of TSCs with similar properties to the undiscovered elemental particles. Proposals for MF-based topological quantum computations are probably the strongest motivation for researchers: The MFs that locate on TSCs could be useful for storage of quantum information and fault-tolerant computation because of their nonlocality and robustness against dephasing.<br>
 
In my talk, I will introduce a concept of the topological phase of matter in the condensed matter physics and try to convince you why it is of interest to explore. Then progress in the search of the most ideal TI candidate both in bulk (bismuth antimony tellurium selenide Bi<sub>2-x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>3-y</sub>Se<sub>y</sub>) and thin-film (bismuth antimony telluride Bi<sub>2-x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) materials will be mentioned. I will also talk about possible routes to realize topological superconductivity, and my talk will focus on our studies on several candidate materials.

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Which gauge theories admit a free particle description?
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> We will introduce a conceptually simple way to measure how close an interacting theory is to a free model. This provides information about the efficient description of its energy spectrum and its entanglement properties. It also determines the ballistic or diffusive transport properties of its excitations, its thermalisation properties, or its ability to be a resource for quantum information tasks. In this talk I will present general results on the effective free fermion description of gauge theories in one, two and three spatial dimensions and the consequences they can have in understanding them or using them for technological applications.

One of the main physics applications of fusion categories is in building lattice Hamiltonian models in the style of Levin-Wen.

 <ul> <b> TITLE: </b> Scattering photons for quantum information processing 
<br>
<br>
     <b>ABSTRACT: </b> The polarization states of photons are ideal carriers of quantum information, since photons travel fast and are relatively robust against decoherence. At the same time, when travelling in free space, it remains difficult to create interactions and to generate entanglement between them. Motivated by their potential applications, we have a closer look at what photons are [1] and show that photons can exhibit a relatively wide range of dynamics. For example, we study the scattering of photons through semi-transparent mirrors, like beam splitters and mirrors, with applications in quantum information processing [2]. Moreover, photons in optical cavities with instantaneous quantum feedback can exhibit non-linear and non-ergodic dynamics with potential applications in quantum metrology [3,4]. <br/>
